# Crystal Game
This is a game in which the player must click on crystals and keep track of their numerical values in order to reach a target number. The game is intended for anyone who enjoys math and logic games.

## How to run site


I created a simple game in html, with a linked css file to format the page and a javascript file to write dynamic programs, which allow the 
game to run. 



## How to play
The game generates a random target number and then sets the attribute of each crystal image to a random number. By clicking on each picture, the number value of the attribute of that image is added to that player's score. The goal is to match the score to the target number. If this happens, the player wins. If the score becomes greater than the target value, the player loses.
