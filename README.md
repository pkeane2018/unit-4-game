# unit-4-game
I created a simple game in html, with a linked css file to format the page and a javascript file to write dynamic programs, which allow the game to run. The game generates a random target number and then sets the attribute of each crystal image to a random number. By clicking on each picture, the number value of the attribute of that image is added to that player's score. The goal is to match the score to the target number. If this happens, the player wins. If the score becomes greater than the target value, the player loses.
